### Architecture Overview of Dependency Management System

The tool (DMS, aka "Dependency Walker", "Dependecny Viewer (depview)"),  would essentially be a **Dependency Management System** for IT infrastructure and application development. This tool will help organize and track various dependencies, such as:

-   **Infrastructure components** (e.g., servers, networking, storage, cloud services, etc.)
-   **Application dependencies** (e.g., libraries, APIs, configurations, versions, etc.)
-   **Configuration management** (e.g., environment variables, container definitions, deployment scripts)
-   **Credentals** (e.g service accounts, etc.)

### Key Features:

-   **JSON-based storage**: Every tracked element (infrastructure, applications, and their dependencies) will be represented as JSON files.
-   **Indexing & Cross-Referencing**: Each dependency and its components will be indexed for efficient lookups and cross-referencing.
-   **CLI Interface**: The tool will provide a CLI for adding, querying, and managing dependencies.
-   **Versioning**: Optionally, dependencies can have versioning for tracking changes over time.
-   **Search and Query**: The tool should allow querying based on attributes (e.g., "Which apps depend on Library X?", "What services are using Server A?").

### Components of the Architecture

1.  **Core Entities/Elements**:

    -   **Infrastructure Elements**: Servers, VMs, Cloud services, network configurations, databases, etc.
    -   **Application Dependencies**: Libraries, packages, Docker images, APIs, etc.
    -   **Index & Metadata**: All entities should have metadata and relationships tracked through an indexing mechanism.
2.  **Storage**:

    -   **File-based storage**: Dependencies are stored in JSON files in a structured directory format.
    -   **Indexing**: Maintain an index of relationships between entities (e.g., "App A depends on Library B and Server X").
3.  **CLI Interface**:

    -   A simple CLI interface allows users to:

        -   Add/update entities (infrastructure components, application dependencies)
        -   List all dependencies of a specific element
        -   Search for cross-dependencies
        -   Export dependency graphs in JSON
4.  **Dependency Tracker**:

    -   A service that continuously tracks and updates the relationships between the various components (via file watchers or event-driven mechanisms).
    -   For instance, if a new dependency is added to a specific server or an application, the corresponding JSON files are updated and indexed.

### Data Model

Each component will be represented in JSON format. Below is an example of the structure for different entities.

### High-Level Implementation in Golang

1.  **Directory Structure**:

    -   `/data/infrastructure/` – Stores JSON files for infrastructure components.
    -   `/data/apps/` – Stores JSON files for applications.
    -   `/data/libraries/` – Stores JSON files for libraries and packages.
    -   `/data/index.json` – Central file for indexing dependencies across components.
2.  **Golang Package Structure**:

    -   `main.go`: The entry point of the application (with CLI initialization).
    -   `cmd/`: Contains CLI command logic.
    -   `pkg/`:

        -   `storage/`: Logic for reading and writing JSON files.
        -   `index/`: Logic for maintaining and querying the dependency index.
        -   `models/`: Structs that represent the JSON schema (Infrastructure, Application, Library).

### Example Usage (sample commands):

```
# Add a server
./dms add server --name prod-server-01 --ip 192.168.1.1 --os linux

# Add an application
./dms add app --name payment-service --version 1.0.0 --depends-on server_1 library_1


# Query all dependencies of an app
./dms query app --name payment-service

# List all infrastructure components
./dms list infrastructure
```
